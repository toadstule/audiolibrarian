# Test Data #

## Audio Files ##

The files in this directory include flac, m4a and mp3 audio files that contain a very short segment
of audio.

### Un-tagged Audio ###

Files named `00.*` have blank tags and can be used to verify that we don't introduce unintended
tags.

### Tagged Audio ###

Files not named `00.*` contain Picard-generated tags and can be used to verify that the tags we
create match those generated by Picard. Periodically, something may change in the MusicBrainz
database or Picard may change its tagging behavior, and these files will need to be updated. This
can be done using Picard. If the test files are modified, the checksums will need to be updated as
well (see below).

### Checksums ###

We track checksums on all files so we can verify that the tests don't change the files. When the
files are manually updated, the checksums will need to be updated as well:

```bash
rm checksums && md5sum *.(flac|m4a|mp3) > checksums
```
